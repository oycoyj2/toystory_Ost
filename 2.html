<br>You've got a friend in me
<br>When the road looks rough ahead
<br>And you're miles and miles
<br>From your nice warm bed
<br>You just remember what your old pal said
<br>Boy, you've got a friend in me
<br>Yeah, you've got a friend in me</p>
<p>You've got a friend in me
<br>You've got a friend in me
<br>You got troubles, I've got 'em too
<br>There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
<br>We stick together and see it through
<br>'Cause you've got a friend in me
<br>You've got a friend in me</p>
<p>Some other folks might be
<br>A little bit smarter than I am
<br>Bigger and stronger too
<br>Maybe
<br>But none of them will ever love you
<br>The way I do
<br>It's me and you, boy</p>
<p>And as the years go by
<br>Our friendship will never die
<br>You're gonna see it's our destiny
<br>You've got a friend in me
<br>You've got a friend in me
<br>You've got a friend in me</p>
