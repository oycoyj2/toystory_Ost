<h2>When she loved me</h2>

<p>When somebody loved me
<br>Everything was beautiful
<br>Every hour we spent together
<br>Lives within my heart
<br>And when she was sad
<br> was there to dry her tears
<br>And when she was happy, so was I

<p>Through the summer and the fall
<br>We had each other, that was all
<br>Just she and I together
<br>Like it was meant to be</p>
<p>And when she was lonely
<br>I was there to comfort her
<br>And I knew that she loved me
<br>So the years went by
<br>I stayed the same
<br>But she began to drift away
<br>I was left alone
<br>Still I waited for the day
When she'd say, "I will always love you."</p>
<p>Lonely and forgotten
<br>Never thought she'd look my way
<br>And she smiled at me and held me
<br>Just like she used to do
<br>Like she loved me
<br>When she loved me</P>
<p>When somebody loved me
<br>Everything was beautiful
<br>Every hour we spent together
<br>Lives within my heart
<br>When she loved me</P>
